# my_vimrc
========

The custom vimrc file for my OSX, Linux and Windows.

## Added items
The follow items were added to my .vimrc files.
- vundle setup
- taglist setup
- NERDtree setup
- source explorer setup
- trinity toggle setup

## Current Bugs (?)
The current version have a problem in the environment of OSX.
- mapping plugin toggling to function key

The problem may be based on OSX default setup of function keys.
It occurs in the case I use third party keyboard (Realforce 87U).

## Future items
The follow items are not yet added.
- font configuration (especially for environment of Korean Windows platform)
